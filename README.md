# ROTYprediction
This project uses past historical data to build a logisitic regression model that predicts the 2025-26 rookie of the year in the NBA. I employed R programming language to conduct all the analysis and model building, consisting of data acqusition, data cleaning, model analysis, and model testing. I used data dating back to the 2002-03 season for the process, building the model up until the 2021-22 season to then test on the 3 most recent seasons. This led me to the conclusion that I constructed an effective model in terms of predicting, which I then used to predict this seasons rookie of the year, assuming stat ranks held for the entire season.
